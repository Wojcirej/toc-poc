Generate table of contents based on the webpage content. Content might be multilevel list.

# Development environment setup
`npm install`

# Run tests
`npm test`

# Deploy
## Dev
`npm run deploy:dev`

## Prod
`npm run deploy:prod`

Before deployment, you might want to setup infrastructure first - either with `npm run setup:dev` or `npm run setup:production`, so you can have an actual place where you want to host it. ;)
